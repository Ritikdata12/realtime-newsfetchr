# Real-Time News Aggregator with AI Summarization

## Project Overview
This project is a Real-Time News Aggregator that integrates AI-powered news summarization. It provides users with the latest news in multiple categories such as politics, technology, food, and health. The application allows users to browse the news, read the summaries, and subscribe to specific categories for regular updates.

### Key Objectives:
- Aggregate news from various sources in real-time.
- Provide AI-generated summaries of news articles for quick consumption.
- User authentication with JWT.
- Notifications for breaking news or personalized updates.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **ReactJS**: The frontend is built using React, ensuring a smooth, component-based UI experience.
- **React Bootstrap**: Used for responsive and clean UI components.
- **React Router**: To handle different routes like home, news feed, and user authentication.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for layout, with specific attention to responsive design for mobile and desktop.

### Backend:
- **Express.js**: Node.js framework used to handle RESTful API requests and manage server-side logic.
- **Prisma**: ORM tool to interface with the database, managing schema, queries, and migrations.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to the backend APIs for fetching news articles.
- **JWT**: Used for secure authentication of users and managing subscriptions.

### AI Integration:
- **Hugging Face Transformers API**: Integrated for generating news summaries from the title and description part and show on frontend.

### Database:
- **Postgresql**: SQL database used to store user data, subscription preferences, and news article data.
- **Prisma ORM**: Used as a data modeling tool to manage interactions with the neon postgresql database.

### Deployment:
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.

### Tools & Libraries:
- **TypeScript**: For type safety in both backend and frontend.
- **Postman**: API testing during the development phase.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing the frontend components.
